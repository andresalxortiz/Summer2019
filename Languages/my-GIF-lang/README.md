# GIF Katas

## Summary

This folder is for all gif-related katas. Katas are split into three categories:
_Easy_, _Medium_, and _Hard_.

There is one starting example kata in the test folder, along with the images of the gif it creates.

__Add your katas to examples.rkt! Please follow the already established formatting!__

So far, the protocol for creating gifs in Racket has been to use a web application to split a desired gif
into its individual frame images and to download those. Then, the user alters these images to add to the gif
and puts these images into a scene with the function 'big-bang'.

The gifs in the asset folder are all currently .gif files, if this changes then please update this README file.

Also, if a better protocol is found for creating gifs in Racket, please update this README file.

Good luck!
