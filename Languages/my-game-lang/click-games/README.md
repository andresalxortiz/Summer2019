# Click Game

## Summary 
I didn't get around to finishing this, but the idea was to have a game that spawned a list of randomly located squares
that would turn invisible once clicked. Each clicked square would increase a visible scoreboard, similar to the scoreboard we saw
in the asteroids5 racket example on github.
