;OBJECTIVE: Make a program that draws a sky with a sun when the mouse isn't being pressed, and a night sky with stars and a moon when it is being pressed.

;myStar takes the size of the star and returns a gold star shape of that size
(define (myStar size)
  (star size 'solid 'gold))

;Whether to draw the night (as opposed to day)
(define night #f)

;pos is a list of where the night shapes are drawn. shapesNight is a list of shapes that are drawn when night is true.
;shapesDay is the sun shape
(define pos (list (make-posn 50 50)(make-posn 250 80)(make-posn 100 150)(make-posn 120 50)(make-posn 50 200)))
(define shapesNight (list (circle 40 'solid 'white) (myStar 20) (myStar 30) (myStar 10) (myStar 40)))
(define shapesDay (circle 40 'solid 'yellow))

;Draws the night images if night is true and the day image if night is false
(define (draw-brush state)
  (if night
  (place-images shapesNight pos  
               (empty-scene 300 300 "midnight blue" ))
  (place-image shapesDay 50 50  (empty-scene 300 300 "sky blue"))))

;If the mouse is being pressed, set night to true. Otherwise, set it to false.
 (define (mouse-handler w x y me)
   (if (mouse=? me "button-down") (set! night #t) (set! night #f)))

;Start the universe. mouse-handler will be called when the mouse does something and draw-brush everytime the image shown is changed.
