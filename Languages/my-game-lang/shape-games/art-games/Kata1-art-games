;Kata 1: Draw a purple pulled polygon

;A rectangle is drawn at position (100,100) in a 200 by 200 frame.
(define (my-rectangle state)
  (place-image poly 100 100
               (empty-scene 200 200)))

;rect is a function that draws our pulled polygon.
(define poly
  (pulled-regular-polygon 50 5 1.1 140 "solid" "purple") )

;big-bang starts the world. 0 is the initial state of the game's internal clock. add1 is called after every tick of the clock.
;spinning-rectangle is called everytime something about the image shown changes. They both automatically pass the clock time
;as the first parameter.
