;OBJECTIVE: Have the mouse only draw when it's being pressed.

;this defines the red circle that will be used for a brush stroke
(define brush
  (circle 5 'solid 'red))
;defines the boolean that indicates whether or not this is the first time the program is drawing a circle
(define firstTime #t)
;defines the list posns and includes a first item that will be replaced the first time the mouse detects movement.
;(The program throws errors if the list is empty so we put in a throwaway position to start with)
(define oldPos (list (make-posn 10 10)))
;defines a list including the circles the program will draw
(define circles (list brush))

;this defines the function that draws the circles. It takes a parameter that is never used because to-draw functions must always
;take the state as a parameter. When firstTime is true, it draws an empty box since we don't have any circles yet and don't
;want to draw the throwaway circle. When firstTime is false it draws all of the circles using the two previously defined lists of
;positions and circles and places them on an empty scene to make the "drawing"
(define (draw-brush state)
  (if firstTime (rectangle 300 300 'outline 'black) 
  (place-images circles oldPos  
               (empty-scene 300 300 "transparent" ))))

;This mouse-handler function runs any time a mouse movement is detected. When firstTime is true, it replaces the throwaway position
;with the current mouse position and sets firstTime to false. When firstTime is no longer true, it appends the new mouse position
;to the list of positions and adds a new red circle to the list of circles.
;This time, it includes an overarching if statement that only runs the rest of the code if the mouse is being dragged
(define (mouse-handler w x y me)
  (if (mouse=? me "drag") (begin (if firstTime (begin(set! oldPos (list (make-posn x y))) (set! firstTime #f))
(begin (set! oldPos (append oldPos (list (make-posn x y))))
  (set! circles (append circles (list brush)))))) (+ 3 2)));Find another way to do nothing besides adding numbers!!!!
  
;This creates the universe, calls the draw-brush function and includes the mouse-handler
