;OBJECTIVE: Create a rectangle whose color changes between red and green intermittently
(require 2htdp/universe 2htdp/image)

;defines a boolean to determine the color
(define rectColor #t)

;defines color rectangle function which calls the rect function. Alternates the color based on mod 10 of the clock from the big bang
;places image on a 200 by 200 frame
(define (color-rectangle state)
  (if (equal? (modulo state 10) 0) (set! rectColor (not rectColor)) (set! rectColor rectColor))
  (place-image (rotate state (rect rectColor))100 100
               (empty-scene 200 200)))

;defines the function drawing the rectangle. Depending on boolean input will make it either red or green
(define (rect rectColor)
  (if rectColor
  (rectangle 100 100 'solid 'red)
   (rectangle 100 100 'solid 'green)))

;big-bang starts the world. 0 is the initial state of the game's internal clock. add1 is called after every tick of the clock.
;spinning-rectangle is called everytime something about the image shown changes. They both automatically pass the clock time
;as the first parameter.
