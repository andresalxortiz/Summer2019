;OBJECTIVE: Make a spinning red rectangle

;spinning-rectangle rotates the rectangle by theta. It is drawn at position (100,100) in a 200 by 200 frame.
(define (spinning-rectangle theta)
  (place-image (rotate theta rect)100 100
               (empty-scene 200 200)))

;rect is a function that draws our rectangle.
(define rect
  (rectangle 100 100 'solid 'red) )

;big-bang starts the world. 0 is the initial state of the game's internal clock. add1 is called after every tick of the clock.
;spinning-rectangle is called everytime something about the image shown changes. They both automatically pass the clock time
;as the first parameter.
