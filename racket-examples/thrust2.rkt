#|

Thrust - (go) to run.

Left / right to rotate
Up to thrust
Space to fire.

TO DO:
- What's wrong with the little triangle and collisions?
- Refactor 2d stuff with vectors
- Scroll around as you fly


DONE:
- Asteroids bounce don't travel through triangles
- Gravity
- Better collision detection, not just centre of ship
