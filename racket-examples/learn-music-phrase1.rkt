Show notes, then play them, see if you get them right!
Press any key if you find the note easy, you'll then
get less time to play this note next time.

Challenge: How to avoid practicing mistakes or quick
corrections, wait for the player to remember first?

CHANGES from v3:
- Add drills to practice phrases of notes:
  (note, note+1 note+2)
  (note, note+2, note+4)
  etc
- Show current note and the next one
- Add back in easy-note logic for phrases - play them less
  often

TODO:
- Fix e2 ledger lines
- Bigger display, scalable with some variable
- Reverse phrases randomly
- Save easy-notes for next time, so that the player
  doesn't need to edit the source code
- Fix display of ledgers
