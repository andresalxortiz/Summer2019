   Today I learned how to create images using the 2htdp/image library. Below is the first image I created, the Green Lantern.

 @blog-post["Day 2 - Intro to Software Engineering (7/16/19)"]{
  Today was my introduction to software engineering. Coding is the first step to software engineering,
  but it is not as important as communication or collaboration.
 }
 @blog-post["Day 3 - Software Engineering Management (7/17/19)"]{
  Today I dove more into the management side of things. I practiced delegating tasks to other engineers
  to maximize efficiency on a project. Also, it helps teach others how tasks are to be accomplished in the future.
 }
 @blog-post["Day 4 - Using Functional Programming for Data Science (7/18/19)"]{
  Today I explored the applications of Racket regarding data science. Specifically, I began teaching myself
  Racket's "plot" library to make graphs.
 }
 @blog-post["Day 5 - More Software Engineering Management (7/19/19)"]{
  Today we continued to assign tasks to the other engineers to contribute to the project.
  I created tickets for the specific tasks that I wanted to get done short-term. I made some dank
  memes using the meme asset library using 2htdp/image so that there is an easy-to-use template for future memes.
 }
 @blog-post["Day 6 - Creating Katas (7/29/19)"]{
  Today I contributed to the repo by creating more game katas.
