                          Today, I learned map, apply, combine and curry which are power traits that can be used in Dr. Racket.
                          I then made my blog to record our progress. I also finally learned what the basics of how the terminal works.
                          I am a bit confused on the terminal operations but hopefully I will strengthen my understanding of it in the next couple of weeks.
                          Also my computer number is 427.

                          I made more katas and organized them afterwards.
                          I also attempted to find a way to display the result of the code in the scribble file but I was unable to for some reason.

                            Today begins the start of week 2.  I am having to retype this because I lost part of my blog.  Anyways, today
                            I went after to fix a bug where my blog wasn't appearing in the file system nor on the bio list
                            in github.   I successfully fixed it after clearing up some un-related errors that were disallowing for the pull
                            to operate.  Also after my first week of being super-confused on how the terminal and github operate, I finally
                            understood the basics and everything including the branching made sense.

                            Well I lost a lot of my additions to my blog I made yesterday so I am retyping some of it that I can remember.
                            I also went on to fix some more branching errors having to deal with stuff not appearing on non-local networks.
                            Finally, I started work on implementing HTML and web-design into dr. racket.

                            Today I learned about the differences between pragmatists and purists.  The lesson made me realize that I
                            prefer the purist approach rather than the pragmatist approach.  I still use the pragmatist approach when I
                            don't think I will be able to plan the entire project/code perfectly.  However if I am not tired and many ideas
                            have popped in my head, my instinct is to not get too ahead of myself without a plan.

                            I also continued my work with HTML in Dr. Racket.
