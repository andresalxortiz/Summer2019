@blog-post["Day 26"]{
Created a profile and bio in Summer2019 and a github account. I worked with Jack to add descriptions to the different sections
 in master-doc.
}

@blog-post["Day 27"]{
Jack and I created pokeball animation katas and organized them into a subcollection. We worked with Daniel and Michael to organize
my-fundamentals katas.
}

@blog-post["Day 28"]{
Jack and I began working on a diagram to show the sependencies of files in Summer2019. We figured out how to put text in boxes
and create arrows using pict in Dr. Racket. We also started cataloging the rerquirements of different documents, but we didn't
get very far in this, and there are a lot of dependencies.
}

@blog-post["Day 29"]{
We continued working on the diagram in racket to make a procedure to connect boxes with multiple arrows more easily. Now we can
add a list of elements and the procedure will organize them into a diagram with connecting arrows.
}

@blog-post["Day 29"]{
Jack and I created a draft of the diagram that shows the dependencies between the files in Kata-Collections, Languages, and
scribblings and moved it into the Git-Workflow-Help folder.
}
