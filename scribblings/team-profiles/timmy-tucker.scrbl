 @blog-post["Distributed Cognition - 06/17/19"]{
  Today we learned about distributed cognition, which was referred to as DCog. Distributed cognition is the idea that the mind and its cognition is not limited to the body, and is extended to the surrounding environment. One thought experiment that helped us understand this concept was about two people going to a museum, which can be found in the second paragraph of
  @hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extended_Mind"]{this}
  Wikipedia article. In this example, Otto operates by distributing his cognitive load, while Inga chooses to operate all within her physical mind.

 @blog-post["Recognition vs Recall - 06/18/19"]{
  Talked about the distinction between recognition and recall. Recognition is a more shallow understanding of a concept while recall requires a deeper understanding. We discussed this concept in terms of language specifically how the English language has subsets that require futher fluency.

 @blog-post["Broca's Area - 06/19/19"]{
  After working more on our blogs and using racket functions to uniformly organize our ideas together, we discusses Broca's area. This is a region of the brain named after Pierre Paul Broca. In the 1800s, Broca had a patient who was
  terminally ill and also was experiencing an inability to produce language. After the patient passed, Broca discovered damage to the specific area of the brain that later became Broca's area. Today, we know this area plays a major role
  in language production and comprehension as a whole, however scientists still debate its exact role in how we interact with language.

 @blog-post["Live AMA with Stephen - 06/21/19"]{
  Today Stephen had us write down questions that we had for him, especially related to the field of computer science from both an academic and professional standpoint. Having an hour where we were able to listen to an expert in the field
  discuss its current state and provide value information as future workers was extremely eye-opening and enlightening. I think that while many people could find a plethora of information regarding what languages are popular and where the
  demand is in the workforce, the opportunity to listen to the philosophies that Stephen holds seems much more valuable. Instead of trying to find extremely specific answers to specific questions, I can now use these words of wisdom to
  guide my journey overall in computer science.

 @blog-post["2htdp/image - 7/15/19"]{
  Today we explored a new library used to generate images and create different shapes called 2htdp/image.
  I also learned more about how to use GitHub, which was a largely important skill for the day as an intern returning to project
  weeks after three weeks out. I developed my skills with the terminal and GitHub a lot more this day, and was able to gain more
  knowledge working with much older interns in college.

 @blog-post["Tickets & more 2htdp/image - 7/16/19"] 
  I really enjoyed working today in the office, as the limited space offered a unique opportunity to replicate the reality of the
  workplace environment. Stephen separated us into two different rooms based on our level of experience with computer science,
  allowing the 'senior' interns to work together and play an administrative role by providing tickets for us 'junior' interns to
  solve or fulfill and then push back. I'm looking forward to continuing this dynamic, because it has by far taught me the most about
  working in computer science and the intricate details of working as a software engineer. Although it could use some refactoring,
 I included some code that I am especially proud of below.

Below is my code for a scalable arrow image using 2htdp/image.

 #lang fundamentals

 (define (arrow width height color)

 (rotate 180 (triangle/sss (expt (+ (expt (/ height 5) 2)
 (expt (/ width 2) 2)) 0.5) (expt (+ (expt (/ height 5) 2)
 (expt (/ width 2) 2)) 0.5) width 'solid color))
 0 (* 2 (/ height 5))
 (rectangle (/ width 4) (* 4 (/ height 5)) 'solid color)))

 (arrow 50 100 'blue)

 @blog-post["More Tickets, 2htdp/universe - 7/17/19"] 
  Today we continued our workplace simulation, allowing our junior group to continue developing our skills using 2htdp/image by
  expanding to use 2htdp/universe where we can animate our images. I had a great time reading through the documentation, using
  what information I had to learn what each part of universe does, and creating animations for my images. This bliss that I experienced
  exemplifies the great experience that I am having as an intern. Working during project weeks has definitely solidified my interest in
  computer science, and my love of unique problem solving through code. I've included some code that I developed. I'm especially proud
  of my color-changing text.

      @blog-post["Reverse Engineering & Passing Around Code - 7/18/19"]
       Today was really interesting and exciting, especially as it came to a close. We began by doing an exercise where each person
       started with the same code, and we kept passing around our laptops and adding different things to everybody else's code. It
       was really cool to be able to combine each of our unique styles and experience how difficult it can be to quickly comprehend
       someone else's code. Earlier in the day I was trying to use a mutable pair in big bang to track position in order to implement
       x and y movement, and by the end of class I was able to use what we learned about structs to implement this feature into a
       game. Overall, the day was really successful and I learned a lot about code styles.

       @blog-post["More work with tickets, wrapping up week - 7/19/19"]
       Today was bittersweet, since I got a lot of time to just work on code and work on GitHub, but it was also my last day of my
       internship with ThoughtSTEM. We worked with more code from Eric Clack and then did more work on the repo using assigned tickets.
       Again, I felt like I expanded my knowledge both about Racket and also about GitHub and collaborative programming. Overall, I've
       learned a lot from this internship, and I am grateful that I had the opportunity to participate and absorb knowledge both from
       Stephen and from my peers.
