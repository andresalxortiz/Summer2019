@title{Game Katas}

These step-by-step kata sets teach how to use the 2htdp/universe library.
Progressing through each set is meant to become progressively harder, each kata teaching a different concept and guiding the user
in creating a different part until the user has built a finished product. 

All katas in this folder aim to teach game-like interaction alongside animation.
