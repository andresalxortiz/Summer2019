#lang racket

;=== NOTES ===
;Work for github issue #342 needs to be completed on this document.
;About half the katas from my-data-sci-lang/examples.rkt have been put in here. The rest still need to be added.
;Follow the format that has been used so far. For help, reference my-game-katas/katas.rkt which is the same kind
;of document as this one but it has been finished.
;Some of the stimuli in my-data-sci-lang/examples.rkt don't have stimuli, go ahead and make your own.
